React Chat
==============
Here at Input Logic, every Friday afternoon we do "Tech, Talk & Tinkering" (TTT).
This is a chance for our team to learn, have some fun and share new technologies.

This weeks topic is React. We're building a pure React (no Redux) chat client
w/ websockets.

Notes
-----
- We're using CDNs to make pulling and testing easier for others
- Using ExpressJS to serve statics and websockets so chrome doesn't complain
  about CORS
